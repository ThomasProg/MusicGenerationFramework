# Runtime Modules

## Summary

They are the modules that are going to be used at runtime, when generating music.\
They are in C++ for performance, but export C functions so that they can be used by other languages.

There are different types of runtime modules.

## Input Preprocessing Modules (IPM)

Before a Machine Learning model is used, input data has to be preprocesssed. 

## Output Preprocessing Modules (OPM)

After a Machine Learning model is used, output data has to be preprocesssed.

## Prebuilt Binaries

Some modules are prebuilt, mainly because they come from external sources.

## Test Modules

They are used to test if a module is working or not.
